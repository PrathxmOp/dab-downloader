## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Development Status**

üöß **This project is currently in active, unstable development.** üöß

- **Frequent Breaking Changes**: Features may work one day and break the next
- **Regular Updates Required**: You'll need to update frequently to get the latest fixes
- **Expect Issues**: Something always seems to break when i fix something else
- **Pre-Stable Release**: We're working toward a stable v1.0, but we're not there yet

**üì¢ We strongly recommend:**
- ‚úÖ Joining our [Signal Support Group](https://signal.group/#CjQKIARVUX48EP6g9DSPb2n1v6fAkxGQvdJJSWc4KLa4KFVyEhDCRiJon09heXcckPnkX6k2) for real-time updates
- ‚úÖ Checking for updates daily if you're actively using the tool
- ‚úÖ Being prepared to troubleshoot and report issues
- ‚úÖ Having patience as we work through the bugs

**üë§ Solo Developer Project:** This tool is developed and maintained by a single developer. While I work hard to push frequent updates and fixes (often multiple commits per day), expect some instability as I can't test every scenario across all systems.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Using `auto-dl.sh` Script (Recommended)

This script simplifies the process of downloading and keeping `dab-downloader` updated. It fetches the latest version and places it in your current directory.

**Direct execution with curl:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrathxmOp/Support-group-junk/main/Scripts/auto-dl.sh | bash
```

**Alternative methods:**

**Using wget (if curl is not available):**
```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrathxmOp/Support-group-junk/main/Scripts/auto-dl.sh | bash
```

**Download first, then execute (safer approach):**
```bash
curl -fsSL -o auto-dl.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrathxmOp/Support-group-junk/main/Scripts/auto-dl.sh
chmod +x auto-dl.sh
./auto-dl.sh
```

### Option 2: Pre-built Binary

1. Download the latest release from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/PrathxmOp/dab-downloader/releases/latest)
2. Extract the archive.
3. Grant execute permissions to the binary:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ./dab-downloader-linux-arm64 # Or the appropriate binary for your system
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./dab-downloader-linux-arm64 # Or the appropriate binary for your system
   ```
5. Follow the interactive setup on first launch

### Option 3: Build from Source

**Prerequisites:**
- Go 1.19 or later ([Download here](https://golang.org/dl/))

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PrathxmOp/dab-downloader.git
cd dab-downloader

# Install dependencies and build
go mod tidy
go build -o dab-downloader
```

### Option 4: Docker (Containerized)

To run dab-downloader using a pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub:

1.  **Ensure Docker is installed:** Follow the official Docker installation guide for your system.
2.  **Configure with Docker Compose:**
    *   Make sure your `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to use the `prathxm/dab-downloader:latest` image (as updated by the latest changes).
    *   Create `config` and `music` directories if they don't exist:
        ```bash
        mkdir -p config music
        ```
    *   Copy the example configuration:
        ```bash
        cp config/example-config.json config/config.json
        ```
3.  **Run any command:**
    ```bash
    docker compose run dab-downloader search "your favorite artist"
    ```
    Or, to run in detached mode:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## üîÑ **CRITICAL: Staying Updated**

Due to the unstable nature of this project, **regular updates are essential**:

### üö® **Daily Update Routine (Recommended)**

Since we're constantly fixing bugs and pushing updates, we recommend checking for updates daily:

```bash
# Check for new releases
./dab-downloader --version
```

### Versioning Format

The application uses a versioning format of `vYYYYMMDD-gCOMMIT_HASH` (e.g., `v20250916-g9fb25ac`). This version is embedded into all binaries and Docker images during the build process, ensuring accurate version reporting and update checks.


### Option 1: Pre-built Binary Updates

1.  **Check Daily:** Visit the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/PrathxmOp/dab-downloader/releases/latest) or watch the repository for notifications
2.  **Download:** Get the latest binary for your operating system and architecture
3.  **Replace:** Replace your existing `dab-downloader` executable with the newly downloaded one
4.  **Permissions (Linux/macOS):** If you encounter an "Exec format error" or "Permission denied":
    ```bash
    chmod +x ./dab-downloader-linux-arm64 # Or the appropriate binary for your system
    ```

### Option 2: Source Code Updates

If you built from source, update frequently:

1.  **Pull Latest Changes:**
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```
2.  **Rebuild:**
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    go build -o dab-downloader
    ```

### Option 3: Docker Updates

For Docker users, pull the latest image from Docker Hub:

1.  **Pull Latest Image:**
    ```bash
    docker compose pull
    ```
2.  **Restart Service:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
