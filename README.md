## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Using `auto-dl.sh` Script (Recommended)

This script simplifies the process of downloading and keeping `dab-downloader` updated. It fetches the latest version and places it in your current directory.

**Direct execution with curl:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrathxmOp/Support-group-junk/main/Scripts/auto-dl.sh | bash
```

**Alternative methods:**

**Using wget (if curl is not available):**
```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrathxmOp/Support-group-junk/main/Scripts/auto-dl.sh | bash
```

**Download first, then execute (safer approach):**
```bash
curl -fsSL -o auto-dl.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrathxmOp/Support-group-junk/main/Scripts/auto-dl.sh
chmod +x auto-dl.sh
./auto-dl.sh
```

### Option 2: Pre-built Binary

1. Download the latest release from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/PrathxmOp/dab-downloader/releases/latest)
2. Extract the archive.
3. Grant execute permissions to the binary:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ./dab-downloader-linux-arm64 # Or the appropriate binary for your system
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./dab-downloader-linux-arm64 # Or the appropriate binary for your system
   ```
5. Follow the interactive setup on first launch

### Option 3: Build from Source

**Prerequisites:**
- Go 1.19 or later ([Download here](https://golang.org/dl/))

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PrathxmOp/dab-downloader.git
cd dab-downloader

# Install dependencies and build
go mod tidy
go build -o dab-downloader ./cmd/dab-downloader
```

### Option 4: Docker (Containerized)

To run dab-downloader using a pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub:

1.  **Ensure Docker is installed:** Follow the official Docker installation guide for your system.
2.  **Configure with Docker Compose:**
    *   Make sure your `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to use the `prathxm/dab-downloader:latest` image (as updated by the latest changes).
    *   Create `config` and `music` directories if they don't exist:
        ```bash
        mkdir -p config music
        ```
    *   Copy the example configuration:
        ```bash
        cp config/example-config.json config/config.json
        ```
3.  **Run any command:**
    ```bash
    docker compose run dab-downloader search "your favorite artist"
    ```
    Or, to run in detached mode:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## 🔄 **CRITICAL: Staying Updated**

Due to the unstable nature of this project, **regular updates are essential**:

### 🚨 **Daily Update Routine (Recommended)**

Since we're constantly fixing bugs and pushing updates, we recommend checking for updates daily:

```bash
# Check for new releases
./dab-downloader --version
```

### Versioning Format

The application uses a versioning format of `vYYYYMMDD-gCOMMIT_HASH` (e.g., `v20250916-g9fb25ac`). This version is embedded into all binaries and Docker images during the build process, ensuring accurate version reporting and update checks.


### Option 1: Pre-built Binary Updates

1.  **Check Daily:** Visit the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/PrathxmOp/dab-downloader/releases/latest) or watch the repository for notifications
2.  **Download:** Get the latest binary for your operating system and architecture
3.  **Replace:** Replace your existing `dab-downloader` executable with the newly downloaded one
4.  **Permissions (Linux/macOS):** If you encounter an "Exec format error" or "Permission denied":
    ```bash
    chmod +x ./dab-downloader-linux-arm64 # Or the appropriate binary for your system
    ```

### Option 2: Source Code Updates

If you built from source, update frequently:

1.  **Pull Latest Changes:**
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```
2.  **Rebuild:**
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    go build -o dab-downloader
    ```

### Option 3: Docker Updates

For Docker users, pull the latest image from Docker Hub:

1.  **Pull Latest Image:**
    ```bash
    docker compose pull
    ```
2.  **Restart Service:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## Update Guide

The tool has a built-in update checker. If a new version is available, it will prompt you to update and attempt to open the update guide in your browser.

If the tool fails to open the browser, you can manually update by following these steps:

1.  **Go to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/PrathxmOp/dab-downloader/releases/latest).**
2.  **Download the latest release** for your operating system and architecture.
3.  **Extract the archive.**
4.  **Replace your existing `dab-downloader` executable** with the newly downloaded one.
5.  **(Linux/macOS only) Grant execute permissions** to the new binary:

    ```bash
    chmod +x ./dab-downloader-linux-amd64
    ```

    (Replace `./dab-downloader-linux-amd64` with the actual name of the binary you downloaded).
